## Design Documents

### Tensor Operations Design
A comprehensive design document for tensor operations has been created: [TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md](./TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md). This document outlines the approach for implementing tensor operations, including:

- Tensor creation
- Element-wise operations (addition, multiplication)
- Matrix multiplication
- Activation functions (ReLU, GELU)
- Computation graph execution
- Memory management
- Optimization strategies
- Implementation strategy

The design document has been updated with a detailed implementation strategy that involves creating a new file called `GGMLComputeOps.kt` to contain the actual computation functionality for tensor operations, separate from the tensor creation and management functions in `GGMLOps.kt`. This separation allows for cleaner code organization and easier maintenance.

This design document provides a roadmap for future implementation without risking breaking the existing code.

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. Refine tensor computation functionality
   - ✓ Follow the implementation strategy outlined in the [Tensor Operations Design Document](./TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md)
   - ✓ Computation functions implemented in `GGMLComputeOps.kt` and integrated with `GGMLOps.kt`
   - ✓ Expand support for additional tensor data types (F16, I8, I16, I64)
   - ✓ Fix type mismatch issues in tensor operations
   - Optimize tensor operations for performance

2. Continue implementing the computation graph
   - ✓ Implement forward pass computation (completed)
   - ✓ Implement graph traversal and execution (completed)
   - Implement automatic differentiation
   - Implement optimization for the computation graph

3. Set up unit tests for the implemented components
   - Create unit tests for tensor operations
   - Create unit tests for memory allocation
   - Create integration tests for the computation graph

4. Begin implementing the CPU backend
   - Implement basic CPU tensor operations
   - Optimize for different CPU architectures
   - Implement multi-threading support

5. Implement quantization support
   - Implement 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization
   - Implement quantized operations

## Challenges and Considerations
Some key challenges and considerations for the Kotlin Native port:

1. **Memory Management**: Kotlin Native has a different memory model than C++, which will require careful design for efficient tensor operations
2. **Performance**: Ensuring that the Kotlin implementation maintains comparable performance to the C++ original
3. **Interoperability**: Potentially allowing interoperability with the original C++ code for components that are difficult to port
4. **Metal Integration**: Implementing the Metal backend for Apple Silicon optimization

## Conclusion
The Kotlin Native port of llama.cpp is in its early stages, with only the basic project structure and core data types defined. There is significant work ahead to implement the full functionality of llama.cpp in Kotlin Native, but the project has a clear roadmap and scope.

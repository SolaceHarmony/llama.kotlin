## Build Environment

The project is set up as a Kotlin Multiplatform project with the following structure:

- **Root Directory**: /Volumes/stuff/Projects/SolaceCore/tmp/llama.kotlin
- **Source Directory**: src/nativeMain/kotlin/ai/solace/llamakotlin
- **Build Configuration**: build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts
- **Design Documents**: TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md, GGML_COMPUTE_OPS_DESIGN.md
- **Status Document**: KOTLIN_PORT_STATUS.md

The project targets macOS platforms (both x64 and arm64) and uses Gradle for building. The entry point for the application is defined as "ai.solace.llamakotlin.main".

Note: C/C++ build files (CMakeLists.txt, CMakePresets.json, Makefile) and non-Kotlin related build tools (cmake directory) have been moved to the archive/build-tools folder. GPU backends (CUDA, SYCL, Vulkan, etc.) have been moved to the archive folder. Instead of symbolic links, actual copies of header files are used in the spm-headers directory for Windows compatibility.

## Challenges and Considerations

Some key challenges and considerations for the Kotlin Native port:

1. **Memory Management**: Kotlin Native has a different memory model than C++, which will require careful design for efficient tensor operations
2. **Performance**: Ensuring that the Kotlin implementation maintains comparable performance to the C++ original
3. **Interoperability**: Potentially allowing interoperability with the original C++ code for components that are difficult to port
4. **Metal Integration**: Implementing the Metal backend for Apple Silicon optimization
5. **Quantization**: Implementing efficient quantization support in Kotlin Native
